# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
Bass Rig Curator (BRC). This idea comes from my own experience as a bass guitar player.
The function of the BRC tool is to take the guesswork out of choosing a proper bass and amplifier combo to suit individual needs.
For example, if you're a beginner practicing exclusively in an apartment with thin walls, you don't need a full stack amp (too loud).
Or if you're a jazz player you probably don't want a 5 string LTD bass with active pickups (better for metal).

BRC will take users through a brief questionare about their needs/wants,
compare the answers to the properties of items stored in the database,
and display the matches on the results page
### Features
Login: User will want to login in order to save and revisit their suggestions. There should also be an option to proceed as guest but suggestions will not be saved.
Survey(main feature): Users will fill out a survey of questions regarding their needs (genre, max noise level, budget, etc.). BRC will complare these answers to properties of basses and amps stored in the database and produce matches to a results page.
Browse all items: Users will have the ability to browse all the items currently in the database and manually create combos if desired.
Purchase: Include link on results page to Amazon and/or Guitar Center website for purchase.
### Technologies
C#, SQL
### What I'll Have to Learn
Not sure for now. Project should be inline with what we've learned in the C# portion of Codecamp but I'm sure I'll come across something as we proceed.
